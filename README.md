# [Graphic](https://pub.dev/packages/graphic)

Graphic is a declarative, interactive grammar of data visualization. It provides a Flutter charting library.

- **A Grammar of Graphics**: Graphic derives from Leland Wilkinson's book *The Grammar of Graphics*, and tries to balance between theoretical beauty and practicability. It inherits most concepts, like the graphic algebra.
- **Declarative and Reactive**: As is encouraged in Flutter, the chart widget of Graphic is declarative and reactive. The grammar of data visualization is implemented by a declarative specification and the chart will reevaluate automatically on widget update.
- **Interactive**: With the *signal* and *selection* mechanism, the chart is highly interactive. It is easy to pop a tooltip or scale the coordinate.
- **Customizable**: With the *shape* and *figure* classes, it's easy to custom your own element, tooltip, annotation, etc.
- **Dataflow Graph and Operators**: Graphic has a internal structure of a dataflow graph and operators. That is how the reactive reevaluation and interaction is implemented.
